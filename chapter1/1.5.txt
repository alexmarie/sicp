(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))

]=> (test 0 (p))

If applicative-order evaluation is used, (p) will be evaulated first. Evaluating (p) causes an infinite loop. Using normal-order evaluation, the
if check will return true and short circuit to returning 0 without
ever evaulating (p).
